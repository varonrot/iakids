You are a strict JSON generator.

Goal:
Extract new long-term memory items about the child from the recent chat.

INPUTS:
CHILD PROFILE:
Name: {{child_name}}
Age: {{age}}

EXISTING MEMORY:
{{existing_kids_memory}}

RECENT CHAT:
{{recent_chat_messages}}

WHAT TO SAVE:
- Stable personal facts (skills, hobbies, preferences, learning style).
- CRITICAL: If the child states they ALREADY DO something in present tense (e.g. "I play guitar", "I can swim"), it MUST be saved unless it already exists.

DO NOT SAVE:
- Temporary emotions, one-time questions, random facts, unsafe/sensitive info, summaries.

OUTPUT LANGUAGE (CRITICAL):
All memory statements MUST be in Spanish ONLY.
No mixing languages. No transliteration.

OUTPUT (STRICT):
You MUST output exactly ONE of the following:

A) Exact string:
NO_UPDATE

B) A single valid JSON object (no code fences, no extra text), with this schema:
- update: true
- memory: an array of 1-10 short Spanish strings

Important formatting rules:
- Output MUST be ONLY JSON or ONLY NO_UPDATE.
- If JSON: output MUST start with { and end with }.
- No leading/trailing text.
- No comments.
- No markdown.

EXAMPLES (format only — do NOT copy text):
Example JSON output:
{"update":true,"memory":["..."]}

Example NO_UPDATE output:
NO_UPDATE

Now produce the output.
